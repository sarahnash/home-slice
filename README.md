## Project Description

HomeSlice serves to fill the gap between locating the home of your dreams and quickly assessing the amenities around it.  For anyone who has done a house search and then opened Google maps to see what's actually around your options, this app meets your needs. Designed for urban dwellers who want to be near a bike path and suburban homesteads that need a grocery store nearby - the house is only the beginning.

## Learning Objectives

To have the skills necessary to understand
much of the world of web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Each student in the group 
used these skills to learn something new and use it in a "real world" way. 
Searching for external resources and being able to understand and apply documentation
is a big part of software development. Whether it is an API, a new JavaScript library,
deployment, testing, etc. We learned many new things and put our web development skills to
work!

Another goal of this project was polish / thoroughness. A thorough `README.md`,
testing via Travis CI, deploying to a public web server, thoughtful commit
messages, following a PR review process, good code organization, etc are all
signals of quality software development. The end result of this project is
a portfolio piece that we are excited to put on our resume and share with
friends and family: "Hey - look at this cool thing we built!"
