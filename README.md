## Learning Objectives

<!-- need to rewrite with better intent of the project -->

By the end of Phase 1 you should have most of the skills necessary to understand
much of the world of web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). The intent with
these requirements is for each student in the group to use these skills to learn
something new and use it in a "real world" way. Searching for external resources
and being able to understand and apply documentation is a big part of software
development. Whether it is an API, a new JavaScript library, deployment,
testing, etc. Go learn something new and put those web development skills to
work!

Another goal of this project is polish / thoroughness. A thorough `README.md`,
testing via Travis CI, deploying to a public web server, thoughtful commit
messages, following a PR review process, good code organization, etc are all
signals of quality software development. The end result of this project should
be a portfolio piece that you are excited to put on your resume and share with
friends and family: "Hey - look at this cool thing I built!" Look for
opportunities to polish and show the world what you can do!
